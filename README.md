# HowBlackoutLoadoutsShouldBe
I created this maybe to see these used in Blackout servers on PC/XBOX/PlayStation. This is how they should have been made!!
There never should be an all-white loadout on a green map...
Second weapons should be set in a Ballenced way...
Last if there are non Military Load-outs then make them creator load-outs like FrankieOnPcIn1080p or Sada Plays known icons of DayZ and ArmA..
